*PS: If you don't want install mysql and redis you can use the [docker compose](./docker-compose.yml) with command `docker-compose up -d`.*

## Explanation of files/folders:

* [Backend](./Backend/) - Folder with all backend code
* [devOpsWiki](./devOpsWiki/) - Folder with all depOps wiki docs *(The content of this folder is in portuguese)*
* [FrontEnd](./FrontEnd/) - Folder with all frontend code
* [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) - docker-compose to run mysql and redis service

## How to use
### Backend:
Before start you need do some steps:
* 1 - create `.env` file using the template from [.env.example](./Backend/.env.example), on this file you need put the some data to run the app
* 2 - create `src/config/cloudStorageKeyFile.json` file using the template from [cloudStorageKeyFile.example.json](./Backend/src/config/cloudStorageKeyFile.example.json), on this file you need put the login data to you google cloud storage
* 3 - use the following commands to create the database:
```bash
$ yarn (Install the dependencies for the project)
$ yarn prisma migrate dev (Create the database)
```

To run in dev mode you need use the flowing commands
```bash
$ yarn dev (Run the app in dev mode)
```

To run in production mode you have two options:
* 1 - Use `docker-compose up -d` command to run in the docker;
* 2 - Use the flowing commands to run in the machine withou docker:
```bash
$ yarn build (Build the app)
$ yarn start (Start the builded app)
```

After having running you can access http://ip:port/api/docs to see all api routes with some documentation

### Frontend:
Before start you need do some steps:
* 1 - install de expo app in you mobile device
* 2 - change the api url in `baseURL` of [api file](./FrontEnd/src/utils/api.ts)

Run the following commands to test the frontend app:
```bash
$ yarn (Install the dependencies for the project)
$ yarn start (Run the app)
```
